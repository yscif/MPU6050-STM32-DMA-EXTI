# MPU6050-STM32-DMA-EXTI
MPU6050 DMA &amp; EXTI HAL library  real time orientation with Madgwick Orientation &amp; Complementary Filter

This repository aims to keep the efficiency at the highest level by giving the workload to all possible hardware in order to achieve maximum performance with minimum code and processing power in STM32 microcontrollers of the MPU6050 sensor.


Madgwick Orientation Filter & Fast inverse sqrt for madgwick filter is taken from https://github.com/nickrehm/dRehmFlight.
